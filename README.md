# Zillow_Scrapper

## Description:
This Zillow scrapper was created for a data mining project done in school. The Zillow API was very limited and we needed a lot of data. 

The purpose of it is to get details about houses for sale in Denver. It loads the Zillow URL in the background and then grabs the source code for the URL. Using the source code we pull historical data, Zestimates, and neighborhood info.

This will give information for about 50 pages worth of houses for sale. I added random sleeps in the code to make sure I got around the Captcha and avoid being flagged as a bot.
